Template for creating web experiments for the Modeling and Decision-Making Lab (MADLAB) lead by <a href="https://steyvers.socsci.uci.edu/">Dr. Mark Steyvers</a>.

This will be a very barebones template for creating your own experiments for the lab. The contents of this repo will be as detailed as possible so that you may be able to clone it and get your experiment up and running in no time :)
